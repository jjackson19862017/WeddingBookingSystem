# Wedding Booking System
 
I am learning PHP, so while I am learning the course I thought I would test my knowledge and understanding as I built it.

So I am planning to build an CMS style interface.

It will only be needed for a hand full of users, so I have created a login screen that will take them to the interface.

The Three different types of users will be:

1. Super - This type of user will have access to everything on the interface.
2. Admin - This type of user will have access to the bookings.
3. Owner - This type of user will have access to the bookings and also the overall profits that would come from present and future bookings.
